\title{Write a methods section document for use with TernTables output}
\usage{
write_methods_doc(
  tbl,
  filename,
  n_levels = 2,
  OR_col = FALSE,
  source = "ternG"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{A tibble created by \code{ternG} or \code{ternD}, or \code{NULL}
when generating a generic document.}

\item{filename}{Output file path ending in \code{.docx}.}

\item{n_levels}{Number of group levels used in \code{ternG} (2 for two-group,
3+ for multi-group). Ignored when called from \code{ternD}.}

\item{OR_col}{Logical; whether odds ratios were calculated. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{source}{Character; \code{"ternG"} or \code{"ternD"}. Controls which
section is populated with dynamic test information. Default \code{"ternG"}.}
}
\description{
Generates a Word document containing boilerplate methods text for all three
table types produced by TernTables (descriptive, two-group comparison, and
three-or-more-group comparison). Each section is headed by a clear label so
the user can copy the relevant paragraph directly into a manuscript. When
called from \code{ternG}, the two-group or multi-group section is populated
with the statistical tests that were actually used; all other sections use
generic boilerplate. When called from \code{ternD}, all comparison sections
use generic boilerplate.
